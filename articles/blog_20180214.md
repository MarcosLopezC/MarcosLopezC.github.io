Here is a fun one.
This is the very first graphical game that I ever wrote; a simple pong clone named `BALLGAME.BAS`.

I wrote this back in high school when I was taking a programing class on [QBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic).
The teacher had just briefly gone over the graphic modes in QBasic.
That weekend, I used what I had learned to write this game.

The teacher had only showed us how to draw points, lines, and arcs;
but that was enough for me to figure out the rest and get the animation to work.

I was very proud when I got back to class and showed everyone what I had done.
