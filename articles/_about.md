My name is Marcos Vladimir López Castellanos and I'm a software developer based in [Fort Lauderdale, Florida][wiki_fort_lauderdale].
I graduated from [Florida Atlantic University][wiki_fau] in 2014 with a Bachelor's degree in [Computer Science][fau_computer_science].
Nowadays I mainly work with JavaScript, C#, and T-SQL but I'm also fluent in many other programing languages.

My work experience includes developing web sites, web applications, and web services for the hospitality sector.
The scope of my work generally involves writing software for the entire stack of web technologies–all the way from the browser, through the application server, and up to the database.

On my free time I like to play and compose music, take interesting pictures, learn about new computer technologies, and write open-source software.
