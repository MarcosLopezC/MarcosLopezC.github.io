<h1>BALLGAME</h1>
<p><em>Wednesday, February 14, 2018</em></p>
<p><img src="ballgame.png" alt="Ballgame"></p>
<p>Here is a fun one.
This is the very first graphical game that I ever wrote; a simple pong clone named <code>BALLGAME.BAS</code>.</p>
<p>I wrote this back in high school when I was taking a programing class on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic">QBasic</a>.
The teacher had just briefly gone over the graphic modes in QBasic.
That weekend, I used what I had learned to write this game.</p>
<p>The teacher had only showed us how to draw points, lines, and arcs;
but that was enough for me to figure out the rest and get the animation to work.</p>
<p>I was very proud when I got back to class and showed everyone what I had done.</p>
